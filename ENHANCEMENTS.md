  - `V` = velocity in m/s
  - `L` = characteristic length (vessel length)
  - `ν` = kinematic viscosity of seawater (1.19×10⁻⁶ m²/s)
- **Benefit**: Accurate flow regime determination for friction calculations

#### Enhanced Wetted Surface Area
- **Implementation**: Holtrop & Mennen approximation in `calculateWettedSurface()`
- **Formula**: `S = L × (2T + B) × √Cb × (0.453 + 0.4425Cb - 0.2862Cb² + 0.003467B/T + 0.3696 × 0.65)`
- **Benefit**: More accurate resistance calculations based on naval architecture standards

#### Advanced Friction Coefficient Calculation
- **Implementation**: `calculateCf(ReL, ks, L)` with roughness effects
- **Formula**: Smooth + roughness factor based on `ks/L` ratio
- **Benefit**: Realistic friction increase due to fouling roughness

### 2. Sophisticated Fouling Impact Model

- **Benefit**: Realistic wave-making resistance at higher speeds

### 4. Environmental Impact Calculations

#### CO2 Emissions
- **Implementation**: Based on fuel consumption and CO2 factor
- **Formula**: `CO2 = fuel_consumption × 3.16 kg CO2/kg fuel`
- **Benefit**: Accurate environmental impact assessment

#### Annual Impact Projections
- **Implementation**: 2400 operating hours per year assumption
- **Calculations**: Cost, fuel, and CO2 impacts over annual period
- **Benefit**: Long-term operational planning and ROI analysis
